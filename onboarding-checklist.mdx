    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
    curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg add -
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk

    # For macOS
    brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Login to Google Cloud">
    ```bash
    gcloud auth login
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to Development Environment">
    ```bash
    ./scripts/deploy.sh
    ```

    <Note>

## Common Pain Points and Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="box" title="Module not found errors">
    **Solution**: Make sure you've installed all dependencies and that import paths are correct. Check for typos in import statements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="triangle-exclamation" title="TypeScript errors">
    **Solution**: Run `yarn ts` to see detailed error messages. Ensure that your types are properly defined and imported.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="brush" title="Component styling inconsistencies">
    **Solution**: Follow the styling guidelines in the [Component Guide](/architecture/component-guide) document and use theme values for consistent styling.

## Next Steps After Onboarding

As you become more comfortable with the codebase, start exploring these areas:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Look for ways to optimize component rendering and data fetching
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure that all components are accessible to users with disabilities
3. **Testing**: Improve test coverage and learn about testing patterns
4. **Documentation**: Help improve project documentation with clarifications and examples
