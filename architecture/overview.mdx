# HeyHomie Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the HeyHomie architecture.

## System Architecture

HeyHomie follows a modern microservices architecture:

## Key Components

### Frontend

- **Next.js Application**: Server-side rendered React application
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling components
- **SWR**: For data fetching and caching
- **React Context**: For state management

### Backend

- **NestJS Framework**: TypeScript-based backend framework
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database
- **ClickHouse**: Analytics database
- **Redis**: Caching and queue management
- **Medusa**: E-commerce engine integration

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the Next.js frontend
2. Frontend makes API calls to the NestJS backend
3. Backend processes business logic and interacts with databases
4. Response flows back to the frontend

## Infrastructure Architecture

The application is deployed on Google Cloud Platform:

- **Cloud Run**: For containerized services
- **Cloud SQL**: For managed PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Storage**: For static assets and media files
- **Cloud CDN**: For content delivery
- **Cloud Load Balancing**: For traffic management

## Integration Architecture

HeyHomie integrates with several third-party services:

- **Razorpay**: Payment processing
- **ShipRocket**: Shipping and logistics
- **Facebook/Instagram**: Social commerce
- **Gumlet**: Image processing

## Security Architecture

- **JWT Authentication**: For user authentication
- **OTP Verification**: For phone number validation
- **Role-Based Access Control**: For authorization
- **HTTPS**: For secure communication
- **Cloud Armor**: For web application firewall

## Monitoring Architecture

- **Cloud Monitoring**: For system metrics
- **Cloud Logging**: For application logs
- **Error Reporting**: For error tracking
- **Uptime Checks**: For service health monitoring
