# Deployment Overview

This guide provides a high-level overview of the HeyHomie deployment process and infrastructure.

## Deployment Architecture

The HeyHomie platform is deployed using a modern cloud-native architecture:

## Key Components

- **Frontend**: Next.js application deployed on Cloud Run
- **Backend**: NestJS API deployed on Cloud Run
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Cloud SQL
- **Analytics**: ClickHouse for analytics data
- **Cache**: Redis for caching and session management
- **CDN**: Cloud CDN for static assets
- **Storage**: Cloud Storage for media files

## Deployment Environments

We maintain three separate environments:

1. **Development**: For testing new features
2. **Staging**: For pre-production verification
3. **Production**: For end-user access

## Deployment Process

Our continuous deployment pipeline:

1. Code is pushed to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions builds and tests the code
3. Container images are built and pushed to Container Registry
4. Cloud Run services are updated with new images
5. Post-deployment tests verify functionality

## Infrastructure as Code

All infrastructure is managed using Terraform:

```hcl
resource "google_cloud_run_service" "frontend" {
  name     = "heyhomie-frontend"
  location = "asia-south1"

  template {
    spec {
      containers {
        image = "gcr.io/heyhomie/frontend:latest"
      }
    }
  }

  traffic {
    percent         = 100
    latest_revision = true
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Cloud Monitoring**: For infrastructure metrics
- **Cloud Logging**: For centralized logs
- **Error Reporting**: For automated error detection
- **Uptime Checks**: For service availability monitoring

## Security Measures

- HTTPS for all communications
- Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for internal services
- Secret Manager for sensitive configuration
- VPC Service Controls for network isolation

## Deployment Schedule

- **Development**: Continuous deployment on merge to develop branch
- **Staging**: Weekly releases (Tuesdays)
- **Production**: Biweekly releases (alternating Mondays)

## Rollback Procedures

In case of deployment issues:

1. Automated monitoring detects problems
2. On-call engineer is notified
3. Previous stable version is restored
4. Root cause analysis is performed
